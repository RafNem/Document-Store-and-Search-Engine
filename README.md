# Document-Store-and-Search-Engine
This project was a 5-stage program for a Data Structures course @Yeshiva University.

This project was a comprehensive 5-stage program designed for students to gain practice in implementing various data structures for the first time using Java. The data structures included HashTables, Stacks, Tries, Heaps, and BTrees, which were implemented from scratch and then integrated into a larger project. The project also involved writing unit tests using JUnit and Maven, and gaining familiarity with the JSON library and its methods.

The final output of the project was a Document Search Engine coded in Java, which could parse given documents in .txt or .pdf format and store them into different data structures. The system provided various capabilities, such as word search using a Trie, delete using a B-Tree, undo using a Stack, and capacity/caching using a Heap. The project also involved handling the storage of documents and managing memory with two-tier storage (RAM and Disk) based on document and memory limitations, using document compression and decompression, as well as JSON serialization and deserialization.

This project was developed as the semester project for the Data Structures course at Yeshiva University in Spring 2022, where several data structures were coded from scratch, including Hash Tables, Stacks, Tries, Heaps, and B-trees, to create a program that can store documents, search for words in those documents, and perform many other features.
